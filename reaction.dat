# Below are the default parameters that can be changed by uncommenting
# and passing this file to iss_sort during the histogramming stage.
#
# This file is not required to run iss_sort, but if you want meaningfull
# physics histograms at the end, then you should change the parameters
# here to match your experiment. One can have multiple versions of this
# file to sort different runs or apply different recoil gates, etc.


## Reaction definition
#BeamA: 30		# mass number
#BeamZ: 12		# atomic number
#BeamE: 8500.	# the laboratory beam energy in keV/u (note, not the usual MeV/u)
#TargetA: 2		#
#TargetZ: 1		#  
#EjectileA: 1	# in (d,p) the ejectile is the proton
#EjectileZ: 1	# we keep this language even though we have inverse kinematics
#RecoilA: 31	# the recoil is the heavy ion
#RecoilZ: 12	# not the target-like product as in normal kinematics


## Magnetic field settings
#Mfield: 2.0		# Magnetic field strength in Tesla 


## Detector and target geometry
#ArrayDistance: -100.0	# Target to array distance in mm (edge of first wafer; negative upstream; positive downstream)
#ArrayDeadlayer: 0.0005	# Dead layer on surface of the array silicon in mm of Si equivalent
#TargetThickness: 0.2	# Target thickness in mg/cm^2
#TargetOffset.X: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the vertical in mm (positive is up wrt beam direction)
#TargetOffset.Y: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the horizontal in mm (positive is right wrt beam direction)


# EBIS windows
#EBIS_On: 1.20e6		# slow extraction is about 1.2 ms
#EBIS_Off: 2.52e7		# Off window is 20 times the On window


## Recoil cut files
#RecoilCut_0.File: NULL	# ROOT file containing the 2D recoil energy cut for sector 0
#RecoilCut_0.Name: CUTG	# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file for sector 0
#RecoilCut_1.File: NULL	# sector 1
#RecoilCut_1.Name: CUTG	# sector 1
#RecoilCut_2.File: NULL	# sector 2
#RecoilCut_2.Name: CUTG	# sector 2
#RecoilCut_3.File: NULL	# sector 3
#RecoilCut_3.Name: CUTG	# sector 3


## E vs Z cut files
#NumberOfEvsZCuts: 1		# default is 1, but you can have as many as your RAM will handle
#EvsZCut_0.File: NULL		# ROOT file containing the a 2D E vs Z cut
#EvsZCut_0.Name: CUTG		# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file
