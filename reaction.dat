# Below are the default parameters that can be changed by uncommenting
# and passing this file to iss_sort during the histogramming stage.
#
# This file is not required to run iss_sort, but if you want meaningfull
# physics histograms at the end, then you should change the parameters
# here to match your experiment. One can have multiple versions of this
# file to sort different runs or apply different recoil gates, etc.


## Reaction definition
#BeamA: 30		# mass number
#BeamZ: 12		# atomic number
#BeamE: 8500.	# the laboratory beam energy in keV/u (note, not the usual MeV/u)
#TargetA: 2		#
#TargetZ: 1		#  
#EjectileA: 1	# in (d,p) the ejectile is the proton
#EjectileZ: 1	# we keep this language even though we have inverse kinematics
#RecoilA: 31	# the recoil is the heavy ion
#RecoilZ: 12	# not the target-like product as in normal kinematics


## Magnetic field settings
#Mfield: 2.0		# Magnetic field strength in Tesla 


## Detector and target geometry
#ArrayDistance: -100.0	# Target to array distance in mm (edge of first wafer; negative upstream; positive downstream)
#ArrayDeadlayer: 0.0004	# Dead layer on surface of the array silicon in mm of Al (0.4 µm from data sheets)
#TargetThickness: 0.2	# Target thickness in mg/cm^2
#TargetOffset.X: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the vertical in mm (positive is up wrt beam direction)
#TargetOffset.Y: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the horizontal in mm (positive is right wrt beam direction)


# ELUM geometry
#ELUM.Distance: -1.0		# Negative number means it doesn't exist by default (in mm)
#ELUM.OuterRadius: 48.0		# outer radius of the ELUM detector (default for S1, in mm)
#ELUM.InnerRadius: 24.0		# inner radius of the ELUM detector (default for S1, in mm)
#ELUM.Deadlayer: 0.0004		# Dead layer on surface of the ELUM in mm of Al (0.4 µm from data sheets)


# EBIS windows
#EBIS.On: 1.20e6		# slow extraction is about 1.2 ms
#EBIS.Off: 2.52e7		# Off window is 20 times the On window
#EBIS.FillRatio: 20		# Fill ratio for EBIS, default is ratio of time windows

# T1 cut
#T1.Min: 0			# for cutting on the proton impact time
#T1.Max: 1.2e9		# (units of ns)

# Laser mode ON/OFF
#LaserMode: 2		# 0 = laser off only
					# 1 = laser on only
					# 2 = laser on OR off (default, i.e. all data)

# Array-Recoil windows
#ArrayRecoil_PromptTime.Min: -300
#ArrayRecoil_PromptTime.Max: 300
#ArrayRecoil_RandomTime.Min: 600
#ArrayRecoil_RandomTime.Max: 1200

# ELUM-Recoil windows
#ElumRecoil_PromptTime.Min: -300

#ElumRecoil_RandomTime.Min: 600
#ElumRecoil_RandomTime.Max: 1200

## Recoil cut files
#RecoilCut_0.File: NULL	# ROOT file containing the 2D recoil energy cut for sector 0

## E vs Z cut files
#NumberOfEvsZCuts: 1		# default is 1, but you can have as many as your RAM will handle
#EvsZCut_0.File: NULL		# ROOT file containing the a 2D E vs Z cut
#EvsZCut_0.Name: CUTG		# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file
